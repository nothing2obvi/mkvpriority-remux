**MKVPriority** assigns configurable priority scores to audio and subtitle tracks, similar to custom formats in Radarr/Sonarr. MKV flags, such as default and forced, are automatically set for the highest-priority tracks (e.g., 5.1 surround and ASS subtitles), while lower-priority tracks (e.g., stereo audio and PGS subtitles) are deprioritized.

This repository is a fork of [kennethsible/mkvpriority](https://github.com/kennethsible/mkvpriority) that keeps the upstream track-priority behavior and adds optional remux-focused workflows.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> MKVPriority modifies track flags in place using `mkvpropedit` by default (**no remuxing**), allowing media players to automatically select the best audio and subtitle tracks according to your preferences. Remuxing can optionally be enabled in the config to disable track compression or reorder tracks.

## Features

- Assigns **configurable priority scores** to audio and subtitle tracks (similar to **custom formats** in Radarr/Sonarr)
- Automatically sets **default/forced flags** for the highest priority tracks (e.g., Japanese audio and ASS subtitles)
- Deprioritizes **unwanted audio and subtitle tracks** (e.g., English dubs, commentary tracks, signs/songs)
- Optionally remuxes changed files with `mkvmerge --compression -1:none` to disable track compression
- Optionally remuxes files to place video tracks first, then audio/subtitle tracks by score
- Periodically scans your media library using a **cron schedule** and processes new MKV files with a database
- Integrates with Radarr and Sonarr using a **custom script** to process new MKV files as they are imported
- Supports extension modules for optional, user-defined **post-processors**, allowing for edge-case handling

## Docker Image

A Docker image is provided to simplify the installation process and enable quick deployment.

```bash
docker run --rm -v /path/to/media:/media ghcr.io/nothing2obvi/mkvpriority-remux /media
```

### Use a Custom Config

You can specify your own preferences by creating a custom TOML config that defines track filters by name and assigns scores by property. To override the default config, use a bind mount:

```bash
docker run --rm -u ${PUID}:${PGID} \
  -v /path/to/media:/media \
  -v /path/to/mkvpriority/config:/config \
  ghcr.io/nothing2obvi/mkvpriority-remux /media \
  --config /config/custom.toml
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before starting the Docker container, you should pre-create the config folder on the host. Otherwise, Docker will create the folder as the root user, causing Python to raise a `PermissionError`.

### Use an Archive Database

You can periodically process your media library using a cron job and an archive database. To keep track of processed files, create an `archive.db` file and use a bind mount:

```bash
docker run --rm -u ${PUID}:${PGID} \
  -v /path/to/media:/media \
  -v /path/to/mkvpriority/config:/config \
  ghcr.io/nothing2obvi/mkvpriority-remux /media \
  --archive /config/archive.db
```

## TOML Configuration

All behavior is configured through TOML files, which assign priority scores to track properties, such as languages and codecs, and define custom filters for track names, such as "signs" and "songs." To get started, check the example TOML file that has been provided for anime ([see here](https://github.com/nothing2obvi/mkvpriority-remux/blob/main/config.toml)).

### Remux Options

You can enable optional remux steps that run after audio and subtitle flags are changed:

```toml
remux_disable_compression = true
remux_reorder_tracks = true
```

When `remux_disable_compression` is enabled, MKVPriority rewrites the MKV with `mkvmerge --compression -1:none` after track flags are changed. This disables Matroska track compression, which can improve compatibility with clients that do not handle compressed tracks well.

When `remux_reorder_tracks` is enabled, MKVPriority changes the track order according to calculated scores: video tracks stay first, audio tracks are ordered from highest score to lowest score, and subtitle tracks are ordered from highest score to lowest score. If the current track order already matches that score order, MKVPriority skips the reorder remux.

If both options are enabled and both operations are needed, MKVPriority performs one shared `mkvmerge` remux instead of rewriting the file twice. The remux is written to a temporary file in the same directory, then replaces the original MKV only after `mkvmerge` succeeds. These remux steps do not run during `--restore`, and they are logged through the `mkvmerge` logger. In `--dry-run` mode, MKVPriority logs the command it would run without remuxing the file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These options rewrite and replace the MKV file, so they break hardlinks and require enough free disk space for a temporary copy of the file.

### Example: Subtitle Codecs

```toml
[subtitle_codecs]
"S_TEXT/ASS" = 30    # Stylized (Advanced SubStationAlpha)
"S_TEXT/SSA" = 30    # Legacy Stylized (SubStationAlpha)
"S_TEXT/UTF8" = 20   # Plain Text (SubRip/SRT)
"S_TEXT/WEBVTT" = 20 # Web-Based Video Text (Used in Streaming)
"S_HDMV/PGS" = 10    # Image-Based (Used in Blu-rays)
S_VOBSUB = 10        # Legacy Image-Based (Used in DVDs)
```

## Radarr/Sonarr Integration

You can process new MKV files as they are imported into Radarr/Sonarr by adding the custom script `mkvpriority.sh` and selecting 'On File Import' and 'On File Upgrade'. In order for Radarr/Sonarr to recognize the custom script, it must be visible inside the container. When using Radarr/Sonarr, you can assign scores to the original audio language (`org`).

> [!NOTE]
> To add a custom script to Radarr/Sonarr, go to Settings > Connect > Add Connection > Custom Script.

```yaml
mkvpriority:
  image: ghcr.io/nothing2obvi/mkvpriority-remux
  container_name: mkvpriority-remux
  user: ${PUID}:${PGID}
  environment:
    WEBHOOK_PORT: '8080'
    MKVPRIORITY_ARGS: >
      --archive /config/archive.db
  volumes:
    - /path/to/media:/media
    - /path/to/mkvpriority/config:/config
  restart: unless-stopped
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are not using "mkvpriority" as the name of your container, you will need to update it in the custom script.
> Also, verify that the mount point for your media directory in MKVPriority is the same as the one used by Radarr/Sonarr.

### Use Multiple Configs

MKVPriority supports multiple, tag-based configs that can be customized to match the tagging system used in Radarr/Sonarr. For example, you can create a separate config for anime by adding an `anime` tag in Radarr/Sonarr either manually or via auto-tagging. Then, append the `::anime` tag to the config path in the MKVPriority arguments.

```yaml
mkvpriority:
  image: ghcr.io/nothing2obvi/mkvpriority-remux
  container_name: mkvpriority-remux
  user: ${PUID}:${PGID}
  environment:
    WEBHOOK_PORT: '8080'
    MKVPRIORITY_ARGS: >
      --config /config/anime.toml::anime
      --archive /config/archive.db
  volumes:
    - /path/to/media:/media
    - /path/to/mkvpriority/config:/config
  restart: unless-stopped
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Radarr/Sonarr, a given movie or show can have multiple tags. However, MKVPriority only uses the first tag in alphabetical order. Therefore, you may need to create new tags specifically for MKVPriority.

## Cron Scheduler

You can use the built-in cron scheduler to periodically scan your media library and process MKV files. When paired with an archive database, MKVPriority will only process new files with each scan.

```yaml
mkvpriority:
  image: ghcr.io/nothing2obvi/mkvpriority-remux
  container_name: mkvpriority-remux
  user: ${PUID}:${PGID}
  environment:
    TZ: "America/New_York"
    CRON_SCHEDULE: "0 0 * * *"
    CRON_TARGET_PATHS: /media
    MKVPRIORITY_ARGS: >
      --archive /config/archive.db
  volumes:
    - /path/to/media:/media
    - /path/to/mkvpriority/config:/config
  restart: unless-stopped
```

> [!NOTE]
> MKVPriority supports [non-standard macros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Nonstandard_predefined_scheduling_definitions) for cron expressions, such as `@daily` and `@hourly`.

## Extension Modules

MKVPriority supports user-defined extension modules for optional post-processing. This feature is designed to handle complex library edge cases, integrate your workflow with external tools, and provide an open-ended automation framework, such as automatically extracting embedded subtitles or dynamically restyling subtitle fonts.

### Example: Subtitle Extractor

You can use the `subtitle_extractor` extension to extract embedded subtitles with the highest priority score. This may result in smoother playback if your media player doesn't support certain subtitle formats. For example, if the player needs to transcode or burn in embedded subtitles, it must first demux and process the entire MKV container. To use this feature, add `extract_embedded_subtitles = true` to the top level of your config file and include this extension in your arguments.

```text
Naming Format: {basename}.{language}.{default,forced}.{srt,ass}
```

> [!NOTE]
> To avoid changing internal track flags and *only* use external subtitles, use the subtitle extractor with the `--dry-run` argument since subtitle extraction still runs during a dry run, which only prevents changes to the MKV container.

### Example: Subtitle Restyler

You can use the `subtitle_restyler` extension to restyle external subtitles by defining style overrides in your config file. Since this extension operates on external subtitles, it can be seamlessly chained with the subtitle extractor. To ensure this extension only restyles dialogue subtitles, it filters out styles that exceed calibrated thresholds for spatial, karaoke, and drawing tags. A complete list of restylable attributes can be found in the extension's Python script on GitHub.

```toml
[subtitle_styles]
Fontsize = 72
Bold = -1
Outline = 3.6
Shadow = 1.5
```

### Example: Multiplexer (Strip/Reorder Tracks)

You can use the `multiplexer` extension to strip tracks for unwanted languages and reorder tracks by priority scores. To enable it, add the `[multiplexer]` section to your config file and include this extension in your arguments.

```toml
[multiplexer]
strip_tracks = true
reorder_tracks = true
```

### Creating Extensions

You can easily write your own post-processing scripts to handle custom logic.

1. Create a Python script (e.g., `my_extension.py`) inside any of the following:
   - current working directory (recommend for local development)
   - `~/.config/mkvpriority/extensions` (recommended for `pip`)
   - `/config/extensions` (recommended for Docker)
2. Import the `Extension` class and implement the `process_file` method:

   ```python
   class Extension(ABC):
    def __init__(self, extension_name: str | None = None):
        name = extension_name or self.__class__.__name__
        self.extension_logger = logging.getLogger(name)

    @abstractmethod
    def process_file(
        self,
        file_path: Path,
        video_tracks: list[Track],
        audio_tracks: list[Track],
        subtitle_tracks: list[Track],
        config: Config,
        dry_run: bool = False,
    ) -> None:
        raise NotImplementedError
   ```

3. Use `-i/--include` with the script name (without the `.py` extension):

    ```bash
    mkvpriority -i my_extension
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> Check the `extensions` folder in the GitHub repository for example scripts. In addition to the **subtitle extractor**, there's also a **subtitle restyler** that lets you define style overrides in your config file, and there's a **multiplexer** that lets you strip tracks for languages not included in your config file (as well as reorder tracks by priority scores).

## CLI Usage

[`mkvtoolnix`](https://mkvtoolnix.download/) must be installed on your system for `mkvpropedit` (unless you are using the Docker image).

```text
usage: mkvpriority [-h] [-c TOML_PATH[::TAG]] [-a DB_PATH] [-i MODULE_NAME] [-v] [-x] [-q] [-p] [-n] [-r] [INPUT_PATH[::TAG] ...]

positional arguments:
  INPUT_PATH[::TAG]     files or directories

options:
  -c, --config TOML_PATH[::TAG]
  -a, --archive DB_PATH
  -i, --include MODULE_NAME
                        include extension module
  -v, --verbose         inspect track metadata
  -x, --debug           show mkvtoolnix output
  -q, --quiet           suppress logging output
  -p, --prune           prune database entries
  -n, --dry-run         simulate track changes
  -r, --restore         restore original tracks
```

### Python Package

To install the standalone CLI tool (without Docker), you can use `pip`:

```bash
pip install mkvpriority
```

To keep the CLI tool isolated from your environment, you can use [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
uv tool install mkvpriority
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you have `uv` installed, you can also run MKVPriority without installing using `uvx mkvpriority`.

## Hardlinks Limitation

MKVPriority avoids remuxing by using `mkvpropedit`, but this still affects hardlinks since the metadata is modified. To avoid breaking hardlinks, use the subtitle extractor with the `--dry-run` argument ([see here](#example-subtitle-extractor)).
